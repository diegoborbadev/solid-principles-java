# SOLID principles in Java
This is a repository to demonstrate the [*SOLID principles in Java*](https://github.com/diegoborbadev/digpedia/tree/main/Concepts/SOLID#what-is-solid). The *SOLID* principles are a set of five principles that help to write clean, maintainable, and scalable code. The *SOLID* principles are:

- **S**ingle Responsibility Principle: [A class should have only one reason to change.](https://github.com/diegoborbadev/digpedia/blob/main/Concepts/SOLID/SRP.md#single-responsibility-principle)
- **O**pen/Closed Principle: [A class should be open for extension but closed for modification.](https://github.com/diegoborbadev/digpedia/blob/main/Concepts/SOLID/OCP.md#open-closed-principle)
- **L**iskov Substitution Principle: [Subtypes must be substitutable for their base types.](https://github.com/diegoborbadev/digpedia/blob/main/Concepts/SOLID/LSP.md#liskov-substitution-principle)
- **I**nterface Segregation Principle: [A client should never be forced to implement an interface that it doesn't use.](https://github.com/diegoborbadev/digpedia/blob/main/Concepts/SOLID/ISP.md#interface-segregation-principle)
- **D**ependency Inversion Principle: [High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions.](https://github.com/diegoborbadev/digpedia/blob/main/Concepts/SOLID/DIP.md#dependency-inversion-principle)
